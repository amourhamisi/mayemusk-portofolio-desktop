# mayemusk-portofolio-desktop
This is a web design for Maye Musk's portofolio website.


I tried to go for the minimal look!

It has 5 sections that can be scrolled through either from mouse gestures, nav bar or scrollbar.
A go to bottom and top buttons. Current website only has go up.

Also added a more noticable section to showcase Maye's book.

Contacts are all the way to the bottom (they work).
